# javascript-challenge
Name
Java-script challenge

Overview
The primary purpose of this challenge was to integrate a UFO sightings database with an interactive HTML page. The user is presented with full visibility to the dataset upon arrival at the HTML page. They can then narrow the dataset on one of five input elements to focus on the location, date or shape of the sighting that is of most interest to them. 

Approach & Methodology
The project was completed using HTML, d3 and JavaScript. The data set was brought into an app.js file, aligned with the HTML page using d3 and then filter logic is applied based on the user input provided in the HTML experience. 

Key Takeaways
It was pretty exciting to be able to take a data set and provide an interactive user experience via the web. I found the filtering logic of JavaScript challenging to learn and apply in this instance. 

Repository Summary & Deliverables Locator
•	There are three folders titled UFO Level 1, UFO Level 2 and UFO Level 3
•	UFO Level 1 is the simplest application where the user can filer on date
•	UFO Level 2 is a more robust filtering experience where the user can filter on country, state, city, date and shape however the filters must be applied in that order to work properly.
•	UFO Level 3 is an attempt to create a dynamic experience where any filter can be applied in any combination. This filtering approach is incomplete.  

Support
I leaned heavily on the tutor and pre-class support resources to better understand the filtering dynamics of JavaScript. D3 was well represented in the course materials and did not require support.
